# IAT 460 Rule Based System
Procedural Story Generator

I chose to do 2 grammar rulesets

For the story elements I decided to use the story line of 

- Exposition, Conflict, Rising action, Climax, Falling action, and Resolution

complete with it's own characters, setting, and plot points and text generated to produce about 100 words


It has 2 different stories, an adventure story, and a romantic story.


To run this project, just run it through Google Colab Notebook
